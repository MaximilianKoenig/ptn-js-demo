# ptn-js-demo

This repository provides a simple demonstration of how to use the Petri net modeling tool [ptn-js](https://github.com/MaximilianKoenig/ptn-js) in a simple application.

## Setup

Node must be installed to run the demo locally.

To get started, clone the repository on your machine. After navigating to the installation folder, the following commands will start the tool:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

The modeler is then accessible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

For development purposes, you can use a different command to automatically re-bundle on changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```
